? Difference between Standard, Priority, Mobile, & Mobile Priority? 
Standard has the same network precedence as the data previously called "Priority Access" assigned to the residential plans. The Standard data assigned to residential users is now unlimited at all times. The Standard Service Plan assigns an unlimited amount of "Standard" data each month to customers. The Standard Service Plan is designed for personal, family, or household use. Priority is the fastest data available to online customers and has the same network precedence as the data previously called high "Priority Access" assigned to the business and maritime plans. Priority Data limits under the business plans are tallied any time you use Starlink, no longer just during peak hours. Priority data is given network precedence over Standard and Mobile data, meaning users will experience faster and more consistent download and upload speeds, especially during times of peak usage. Mobile has the same network precedence as the data previously called "Basic Access" assigned to Best Effort and RV plans. Unlimited deprioritized data, resulting in degraded service and slower speeds in congested areas and during peak hours. Uninterrupted use of the Service is not guaranteed and is highly dependent on geographical areas. Bandwidth intensive applications, such as streaming video and gaming are most likely to be impacted.Mobile Priority is new. It's the sweetest data yet. It has the same network precedence as "Priority Data," but is the only data available on land, at sea, and for in motion use. Limited data amount set by the service plan that has network precedence over Standard and Mobile data and permitted use in motion on land and open water.

? Starlink on the Ocean? 
Mobile Priority data is required for ocean use. The Mobile Priority service plan enables our fastest network speeds for consumers and can be used on the ocean and land, and is available in 50GB, 1TB, and 5TB plans. If you exceed the allotted data on your Mobile Priority plan and have not opted in to additional Mobile Priority data, you will be unable to access the internet while on the ocean except to access your Starlink account.

? What do we know about the ground infrastructure / gateway site?
To ensure service provision to subscribers, a satellite in the Starlink system currently requires being within the service area of a gateway station. These stations, equipped with multiple antennas and fiber internet connections, serve as communication hubs. MIT researchers estimate that, regardless of the introduction of inter-satellite links, around 123 gateway sites worldwide will be necessary to support the anticipated system bandwidth. As of December 2022, SpaceX has applied to operate approximately 100 gateway sites across the United States and its territories.Due to the substantial coverage of the fairly large gateway service areas, it is expected that these gateways will encompass the majority of land mass. The map's final service areas layer illustrates reduced gateway coverage, which will be implemented when the number of satellites increases significantly and an adequate number of gateways are established. In sparsely populated regions like Alaska, SpaceX may continue employing large gateway service areas.

? With so many Starlink satellites is there a risk of the Kessler syndrome?
Kessler syndrome refers to a scenario where satellites collide, resulting in a debris field that further collides with other satellites, leading to a cascade effect reminiscent of the movie Gravity. While the risk is not entirely eliminated, it is extremely low because Starlink's satellite has a built-in collision avoidance to prevent adding space junks and keeping our space clean.

? What makes Starlink different from other satellite solutions?
Traditional satellite solutions suffer from limited bandwidth and high ping times. Satellites in Geostationary orbit are positioned approximately 35,786 km (22,236 mi) away, resulting in real-world ping times of around 600 to 1200 ms. However, Starlink's innovative approach addresses this issue by deploying a large number of satellites-over 4000 of them-in lower orbits. This configuration significantly reduces the distance between end users and the satellites, resulting in improved ping times. Projections suggest that Starlink aims to operate with impressive ping times ranging from 25 to 50ms, offering a substantial enhancement compared to traditional satellite solutions.
